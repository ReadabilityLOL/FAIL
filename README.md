# Flawed Aggregator of Inconsequential Links
This is an rss feed I made to learn Flask. I used [Vercel](https://vercel.com) to host it. The font used is Handlee by Joe Prince. Currently, it cannot save rss feeds past one session, so it's not advised to use it, but in the future, I might add cookies so it can save rss feeds to the device.
